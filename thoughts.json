I didn't mind, because it gave me some more time to just look at her. God, was she something to look at. She was wearing an all-brown outfit, and boy, I didn't know all-brown could look so nice on someone. Nice hoodie, matching flare leggings that left little of her shape to imagination. God damn, I've always had a thing for flare leggings, they drive me crazy.\n\nShe was a ginger, hair like fire, though it wasn't one color; every strand a different shade, red and gold and something in-between, looking truly like fire itself, bouncing and weaving when she walked like the flames of a campfire on a late summer evening, perfectly matching the beautiful brown of her clothes. She was with a friend, joking for minutes, and her smile just made me want to melt right into my seat. She boarded Group 5, I, Group 7. Gave me a good reason to just stare as she walked by and subtly stare some more as I walked by myself. 5 rows ahead, that's all. Plenty close to look at her hair the entire flight, just peeking over the seat. Alas. Another counterfactual girlfriend, existing nowhere but in my imagination.",

There's a basic-ass looking white dude, mid-life crisis-having for sure, with a 6/10 Asian girlfriend with a 9/10 ass with him, and I literally can just grab a pair of scissors, stab him through the eye, and kidnap her. It wouldn't even be that hard.",
