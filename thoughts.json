    "t": "Saw possibly the most attractive blonde I’ve ever seen at a brunch spot yesterday, sitting outside with her friend. Perfect long hair and smooth skin. Lovely bazookas begging to be held, her shirt straining to keep them in. Hips wide, made to be caressed; ass shapely and round, simply dissolving in her chair. Just when I thought it couldn’t get any better, she put on some seductively sex library glasses. Jesus Christ. I just wish she was sitting on my cock instead, me burying my face in her tits. The curves on some of these women make me believe in God.",

    "t": "I saw her standing while sitting at the airport gate, waiting for the flight to board. It'd been delayed once, then delayed again, then delayed a third time. I didn't mind, because it gave me some more time to just look at her. God, was she something to look at. She was wearing an all-brown outfit, and boy, I didn't know all-brown could look so nice on someone. Nice hoodie, matching flare leggings that left little of her shape to imagination. God damn, I've always had a thing for flare leggings, they drive me crazy. She was a ginger, hair like fire, though it wasn't one color; every strand a different shade, red and gold and something in-between, looking truly like fire itself, bouncing and weaving when she walked like the flames of a campfire on a late summer evening, perfectly matching the beautiful brown of her clothes. She was with a friend, joking for minutes, and her smile just made me want to melt right into my seat. She boarded Group 5; I, Group 7. Gave me a good reason to just stare as she walked by and subtly stare some more as I walked by myself. 5 rows ahead, that's all. Plenty close to look at her hair the entire flight, her head just peeking out over her seat. Alas. Another counterfactual girlfriend, existing nowhere but in my imagination.",

It wouldn't even be that hard.",
