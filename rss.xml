      <description>I saw her standing while sitting at the airport gate, waiting for the flight to board. Itâd been delayed once, then delayed again, then delayed a third time. I didnât mind, because it gave me some more time to just look at her. God, was she something to look at. She was wearing an all-brown outfit, and boy, I didnât know all-brown could look so nice on someone. Nice hoodie, matching flare leggings that left little of her shape to imagination. God damn, Iâve always had a thing for flare leggings, they drive me crazy. 

She was a ginger, hair like fire, though it wasnât one color; every strand a different shade, red and gold and something in-between, looking truly like fire itself, bouncing and weaving when she walked like the flames of a campfire on a late summer evening, perfectly matching the beautiful brown of her clothes. She was with a friend, joking for minutes, and her smile just made me want to melt right into my seat. She boarded Group 5, I, Group 7. Gave me a good reason to just stare as she walked by and subtly stare some more as I walked by myself. 5 rows ahead, thatâs all. Plenty close to look at her hair the entire flight, just peeking over the seat. Alas. Another counterfactual girlfriend, existing nowhere but in my imagination.</description>

      <description>I was calling someone while waiting for the plane to fill up, and was told that it was a bold decision to talk so loudly around other people. Yes, it&apos;s a bold decision, but bold is what I write my signature in.</description>

      <description>So many cute girls at the beach today, god damn. There was one group of 6 that had such perfect asses, tight colorful bikinis, and were full of energy and cheer. Wish they could be full of my cum, too. Only issue is that they&apos;re all almost certainly 15.</description>

      <description>The only thing that can contend with the present is the past or an imagined future.</description>

      <description>Just saw a really hot chick at the beach hit a vape. Attractiveness instantly lowered. I thought, &quot;Instead of sucking the vape, why don&apos;t you suck my dick?&quot;</description>

      <description>What if I literally just killed everyone in this coffee shop right now. It wouldn&apos;t even really be that hard. There&apos;s a basic-ass looking white dude, mid-life crisis-having for sure, with a 6/10 Asian girlfriend with a 9/10 ass with him, and I literally can just grab a pair of scissors, stab him through the eye, and kidnap her. It wouldn&apos;t even be that hard.</description>
